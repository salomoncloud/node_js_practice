# node_js_practice

Node js looks pretty cool, gonna try my hand at this
To run Javascript you need a javascript engine and a runtime to be able to run the code, which is what node does. 
Node is essentially a set of tools for us to write apps that uses the v8 engine (javascript engine) to read the js, and any time something requires action like an event loop or worker threads or event queues, event loops, we would use the libuv library that will communicate between the v8 and libuv to be able to run it all. 
-----
running Node in powershell cli, just typing node is REPL mode (read, eval, print and loop).
When in REPL mode we can type in code and it will respond with output. If you close REPL you will lose track of code you were testing.
